# Symtech Android Question Application

The following is a simple task to assess your familiarity with good Android programming practices.

The application does the following:

* Allows you to search for a subreddit
* Displays a list of subreddits matching your search
* Shows the sidebar of a subreddit in the list, when clicked

There are some obvious issues with the application, as well as some less obvious ones.
We would like you to spend an hour or so improving the application, and will be looking for:

* Code quality and consistency
* Adherence to Android programming guidelines and best practices
* Understanding of GIT and good GIT practices

Once finished, please provide us a link to a public GIT repository, containing the improved application.
